# US-Banking-and-Fintech---Tableau

Project Introduction
This Tableau Data Visualization Project on US Banking and Consumer aims to provide valuable insights
into the financial landscape and consumer behavior in the United States. Leveraging diverse data sources,
including CSV files from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the World Bank, Kaggle,
and other trusted sources, this project intends to create interactive and insightful data visualizations that
will help stakeholders, policymakers, and the general public gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics
within the US banking sector and its impact on consumers.
Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to harness the power of Tableau to transform raw data into
meaningful visual representations. We seek to uncover trends, correlations, and patterns within the
financial and consumer data to facilitate informed decision-making. Through interactive dashboards and
compelling visualizations, our aim is to simplify complex financial data, making it accessible and
comprehensible to US banking partners, emerging Fintech companies and US banking regulators.
Data Description
The project will utilize a rich dataset acquired from various reputable sources, such as the FDIC, World
Bank, Kaggle, and more. This data encompasses a wide range of variables, including banking industry
statistics, consumer spending habits, loan portfolios, interest rates, economic indicators, and demographic
information. The datasets have been curated, will be transformed and integrated to ensure data quality and
consistency.
Methodology
Our methodology involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the development of
interactive Tableau dashboards. We will apply statistical techniques, charts, graphs, measures, and other
visuals available in Tableau. These insights will be transformed into visually compelling dashboards that
provide an intuitive and informative user experience. It will build a story with the data to draw an action
plan for the future.
Expected Outcome
The expected outcome of this project is a set of Tableau dashboards and visualizations that provide a
comprehensive view of the US banking and consumer landscape. Users will be able to explore financial
trends over time, understand the impact of economic variables on consumer behavior, and gain insights
into lending patterns, financial stability, technology trends and more. The project's interactive nature will
empower users to analyze and interpret data on their terms, leading to better-informed decisions in both
public and private sectors.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this project aligns with the increasing demand for data-driven decision-making and will
contribute valuable insights to the financial and consumer sectors. We look forward to executing this
project and delivering meaningful results.
